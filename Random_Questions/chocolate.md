# Chocolate Problem
You want to share pieces of chocolate to your friends by splitting the bar piece by piece from left to right and top to bottom.

Write the program to simulate chocolate bar splitting of the bar size (r x c) and number of your friends (n). Assume that the number of chocolate pieces can be shared among your friends equally without any remainder.

The imput consists of 3 values: size of chocolate bar in row and column and the number of friends.

The output is the chart of chocolate bar that indicates number the allocation of chocolate pieces as number. If the number is two digits, the chart will display only the last digit (i.e., if the number is 10, the chart will show 0).

### For example:

Input:

4 6 3

Output:

111222  
333444  
555666  
777888
