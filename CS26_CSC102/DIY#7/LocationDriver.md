# LocationDriver

Write a Java class named Location that identifies the maximum value and its position in a two-dimensional array. The class contains public data fields: row, column, and maxValue that store the maximal value and its indices in a two-dimensional array with row and column as int types and maxValue as a double type. The class then displays the location of the largest element and its value in the array.

Note: An element is “maximal” if there is no other element greater.

## For example

| **Input**     | **Result** |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| ex | ex |
