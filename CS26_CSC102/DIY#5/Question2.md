# Question 2

Write a program that reads two 2 x 2 matrices and displays their sum. To be added, the two matrices must have the same dimensions and the same or compatible types of elements.

For example, for two 2 x 2 matrices a and b, c is

![fig](../../img/fig)

If matrix 1 is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and matrix 2 is 0 2 4 1 4.5 2.2 1.1 4.3 5.2, then the matrices are added as follows:

![fig](../../img/fig)

Hint: use double as datatype.

## For example

| **Input**     | **Result** |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| 1 2 4 5 <br> 0 2 1 4.5 | 1.0 4.0 <br> 5.0 9.5 |
| ex | ex |
