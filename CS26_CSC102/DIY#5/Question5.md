# Question 5

Given a matrix of size m x n, write a program that modifies the matrix such that if any element in the matrix is 0, the entire row and column containing that element are set to 0. The program should perform this modification in-place, meaning the original matrix should be updated without using any additional matrix storage.

The input to the program is the matrix itself, which may contain both positive and negative integers, and the output should be the modified matrix where all rows and columns containing a 0 have been set to 0 accordingly.

For example: 3 x 3 Matrix
