# Question 1

Write a Java program that performs basic statistical analysis on a two-dimensional array of integers. Your program will calculate and display the following statistics based on the values in the array:

Sum: The total sum of all the values in the array.
Minimum Value: The smallest number in the array.
Maximum Value: The largest number in the array.
Average (Mean): The average of all the numbers in the array.
Median: The middle value when the numbers in the array are sorted in ascending order. If the number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
The program will first accept two integers, m and n, representing the number of rows and columns of the array, followed by the elements of the m x n array.

## For example

| **Input**     | **Result** |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| 2 2 <br> 3 7 <br> 2 4 | Sum: 16 <br> Minimum value: 2 <br> Maximum value: 7 <br> Average value: 4.0 <br> Median value: 3.5 |
